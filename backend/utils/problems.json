  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "description": "Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n. The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.",
  "example": "Example 1:\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 182\nExplanation:\n- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1\n- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1, sum = 9\n- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100, partitioned into 10 and 0, sum = 10\nHence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182"
